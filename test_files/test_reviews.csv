45,"Little lesson on TRUFFLES...<br />Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.<br /><br />Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.<br />NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",little lesson truffle truffle grade extra large than second high truffle quality best use conclusion cook process release aroma perfume chef suggest slice shave thinly pastas risotto omelet whole entire truffle mark brushed mean clean soil dirt preserve brine truffle juice discard use flavor sauce broth ready use preserve truffle nice budget friendly way add visual truffle appeal dish look add pungent aroma taste truffle dish chef recommend explore fresh truffle selection jar canned truffle sell vendor mere shadow fresh truffle selves not themselves deliver aroma flavor fresh truffle great use truffle oil oil add flavor preserved truffle truffle look but preserve truffle use only garnish dish conjunction truffle butter oil time fresh truffle out season budget not allow real thing note preserve truffle out jar almost no flavor odor look true flavor fresh truffle please go seek fresh truffle page online purchase fresh truffle look add truffle look only dish product well buy real truffle oil experiment example jr mushroom specialty amazon good start dollar low commitment line superior bottle extra virgin olive oil evoo,372,8,0.021053,53,0,21,88,176,380,13,0.988,0.496094,3,0,0

Gluten free might help some folks.

175,"I've always been a little curious about barley tea, as I see it often mentioned in manga and Japanese stories. I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand.<br /><br />This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste.<br /><br />There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes. Still very much worth trying and I'm definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general.

I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle.

Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe.

Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!!

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food.

305,"I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).<br /><br />In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.<br /><br />Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.<br /><br />I'm in love.<br /><br />This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.<br /><br />I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.

523,"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.

In my opinion De Cecco makes the best pastas on the market today.  And Penne is my favorite because it's versatile, working well in many dishes, and because it's easier to make sure it stays al dente.  I don't think I've ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though I suppose if you really tried you could do it.  For many years I fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back.  I even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in.

532,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.

This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process.

I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly.

692,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time.

709,"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.<br /><br />FYI Nutrition info:<br />Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />Fiber 2g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 2g<br />Sodium 50g<br /><br />BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people.<br />Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!",what think take first bite find amazon manager s special slightly than box ingredient healthy intrigue seed combination my favorite rosemary garlic no review not really know what expect but give try first very fresh crunchy sell date month away cute little round cracker really tortilla chip tortilla chip best ever very sturdy use scoop anything include thick guacamole not think break crumble delicious taste get first nuance flavor unfortunately diminishes rosemary garlic not really discernible but still get wonderful corn organic seed flavor right amount salt way low than mg not know consider low sodium product but snack process food like jerky lot cracker way too salty me fyi nutrition info serve size oz cracker g serving box calorie total fat g saturate fat g no trans fat cholesterol total carbs g fiber g sugar protein g sodium g way gluten free really important lot people cracker box open intact broken one mostly bottom bag even though perfect really good black bean dip guacamole hummus bottom line look tasty healthy snack cracker chip,446,2,0.004367,109,1,18,75,174,458,30,0.9929,0.534055,5,0,1

711,"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.",bought product target do what think enough research baby food maker originally go get baby bullet but review not good go brezza instead mistake remember people write poor quality bad customer service company itself not amazon open tape use secure plastic bag melt sticky stuff bottom thing scrub soon take out box gotten sticky melted tape my kitchen counter annoy plastic cover button look like lift use something even though brand new tried motor work not terribly loud probably rate noise scale go wash prior first use course direction say remove driveshaft prior wash say turn canister find knob turn counter clock wise driveshaft weld because take me my husband hour loosen enough get out honestly scar put back fear never get back out again get prepared make my first meal carrot follow direction cut up carrot appropriate size but go put water discrepancy direction say put ml water canister premeasured line use amount water correct normally not problem except measured line read ml seriously be left try figure out correct end up go premeasured canister think too much water because carrot come out ridiculously watery still chunk carrot mix not easy get food out blade either see people say time saver work decent quality save time set walk away but end result leaf much desire price expect least get money s worth honestly well off get really nice food processor go old fashion way,515,1,0.001862,51,0,44,99,235,537,13,-0.3743,0.460899,0,2,0

I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.<br /><br />When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.",use standard xlr usb cable my shure dynamic mic work okay except annoy hiss noise accompanies majority my vocal recording buy icicle hope eliminate noise issue receive icicle not wait plug take test drive unfortunately right off get error unable load driver plug play device no driver download knew something not right restarts uninstalling usb hub port numerous time suggest icicle s troubleshoot website still no go go icicle s website log ticket explain issue detail run window next day receive email instruct me send icicle back defective driver amazon great send replacement return way receive replacement icicle today pull out packaging bated breath plug hop success no luck same error message come up driver decide google my issue icicle compatibility windows bam take me guitar center review icicle clearly show product specification not compatible window amazon need get ball add information nowhere amazon s description icicle techs themselves not clue either find inadequacy blue mic technical team unacceptable probably non technical csrs pretend tech troubleshoot way save dime but please people go give us technical support say not really technical support say customer service be terribly disappointed device not upgraded accommodate newer technology windows out time now no indication little mini booklet come icicle package say windows incompatible only give set up info mac windows not show os be send my icicle back amazon refund need look something work windows pc purchase later save yourself hassle not bother product o than likely window,535,10,0.017889,78,0,43,100,244,558,17,0.2379,0.357275,2,1,0

Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste.

Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.",buy my wife birthday she love chocolate staple gift give well year get she only eat put away very strange later catch put garbage try quickly realize why taste like no sugar leave aftertaste remind me badly burn toast brush my teeth get taste out good laugh fortunately give necklace she really love not ruin birthday dollar waste,119,1,0.007812,14,0,14,19,58,128,2,0.9473,0.414697,3,1,0

There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product.

1088,"I have tried 4 different kinds of oolongs, and found this tea to have a very rich, woodsy taste. It brews a dark red/brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs, which brew golden. Although it tastes quite strong, which I like, it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that I love in a previous oolong I've tasted. Those tend to be much more expensive, so I settled for this one. It tastes pretty good & seems good quality for the price. I'm pretty much addicted to oolong tea, so I needed something that I could buy at a good price & still enjoy.",tried different kind oolong find tea very rich woodsy taste brew dark red brown color comparison light oolong brew golden although taste strong like lack sweet aromatic flavor love previous oolong taste tend much expensive settle taste pretty good seem good quality price be pretty much addict oolong tea need something buy good price still enjoy,111,0,0.0,15,0,9,18,56,119,4,0.9877,0.616667,4,0,1
