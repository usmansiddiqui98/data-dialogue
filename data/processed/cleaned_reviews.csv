I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat.

I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.

Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free.

I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well.

Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.

Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.<br /><br />This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber.

45,positive,2021-01-14,"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me.

I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch.

They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them.

58,positive,2021-01-04,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)!

70,negative,2021-09-28,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke.

88,positive,2021-09-23,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it.

89,positive,2021-06-26,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat!

I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information.

Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.<br /><br />I gave some to my dad to try.

Most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid, unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil.  So the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves, which is fine but a bit of a pain.  Kudos to SeaSnax for stepping in and filling the void.  The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product.  Hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit.

The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu.

281,positive,2021-09-20,"Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.<br /><br />My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her.<br />What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food.

294,positive,2021-06-22,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)!

However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.

355,negative,2021-02-05,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors.

380,positive,2020-01-19,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",1835,recently low carb diet find longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave honey dates raise blood sugar spikes insulin hormone whose message store fat insulin also causes kidneys retain water therefore would bloat high carb diet dilemma love sweetsand problem thanks products like stevia natural plant safely used parts world sweetener hundreds years calories impact blood sugar although people might bit brain tricked thinking getting sugar stevia used legal usa cosmetic product politics companies made low calorie sweeteners aspartame want competition yet aspartame gave headaches even sometimes symptoms multiple sclerosis would stevia times aftertaste badand honest crazy taste either tried nunaturals product awesome like stevia tried delicious also aftertaste unless put way mucha common mistake people new comes tablets powdered form bottle handy packets individual servings also comes alcoholfree liquid form even vanilla flavor unlike aspartame becomes even toxic heated stevia used baking nunaturals stevia baking blend since raw fooder cannot tell tastes sure good judging products thanks great products low carb raw diet deprived sweets,1150

That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste.

I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories.

Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon.

We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!!

554,positive,2021-06-29,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.<br /><br />About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.<br /><br />The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.<br /><br />The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.<br /><br />I recommend this product for the taste.

Everyone love it.

I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma.

The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though.

It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.

It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess.

798,positive,2020-02-09,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it.

I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one.

It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.",679,first time tried thought wow great satisfying eating regular potato chips sweeter presumably healthier written review would given 5 stars reason hesitated took work tried began question sweetness question sweet potatoes slightly sweet felt fair let readers know might find product sweet hence reason 4 stars still quite good find sweetness cloying might like product long would still recommend,393

1119,positive,2020-03-04,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.<br /><br />So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.<br /><br />This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.<br /><br />Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]<br /><br />Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit.

1138,positive,2020-01-13,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one).

The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips.

It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.

That said, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is. The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye. So in summary, what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price. I would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack, to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you.",744,sauce tastes pretty good creamy spicy overly nice flavor pairs well burritos mexicanstyle foods said think little bit overpriced bottle quite small 8 fluid ounces twothirds size soda amount sauce get really much make bottle wide skinny appearance capacity concave curves side deceive eye summary tasty sauce offered high price would recommend perhaps looking single bottle local supermarket committing entire sixpack see flavor worth cost,438

The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.<br /><br />The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt.

I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.<br /><br />The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly.

What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition.

1366,positive,2021-07-28,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).<br /><br />It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).<br /><br />It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!<br /><br />But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.",2129,pretty tasty eat sort thing admit rare guilty pleasure compared brand doubt main competitor thought one tasted better probably already mixed almostcheese sauce included also replaces milk usually added pretty much tossup terms nutrition given looking nutritional champ begin prepared one 350 calories per serving 310 140 calories fat 110 one 850 mg sodium one 810 kraft velveeta cheesy skillet comes slightly ahead overall protein 8 g compared others 3 g dietary fiber 1 g compared less gram competitor differences probably attributable cheese sauce sauce also pushes one edge total fat 9 g one 05 ground beef added difference 25 recommended daily amount vs 19 virtually none good fat either one significant although brands claim zero transfat also list partially hydrogenated oil one ingredients meaning certainly contain transfat less halfgram per serving would require full disclosure eat whole package 5 cups realistically dinner leftover lunch two easily might could get whacked much 24 g transfat mention saturated fat ground beef add 800 grams sodium probably need skip another meal day avoid going recommended daily value sodium might consider fasting day plan eat one serving said guilty pleasure definition nutritionally sound choice made case things price availability equal probably choose one choose,1312

I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.  After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.  My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.",1154,got home long trip faced making dinner luckily velveeta cheesy skillet dinner sitting pantry browned pound chicken breast strips followed directions quick easy dinner family everyone enjoyed ingredients come 4 different packets pasta orzo think seasonings dehyrated broccoli velveeta cheese sauce browning chicken add seasoning pasta along 2 12 cups water cover 7 8 minutes add dehydrated broccoli cook another 23 minutes remove heat add cheese sauce kids loved plenty everyone found better tasting chicken helper easier prepare complaint miniscule amount broccoli like sprinkling dried parsley broccoli florets course always add fresh frozen broccoli veggies make healthier heartier overall good choice hectic night much time cook lot hungry little mouths feed,761

There is barely any flavor to this cereal.<br /><br />I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.<br /><br />I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).<br /><br />It is cheaper than granola.

This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.<br /><br />Tips to enjoy it:<br /><br />- Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.<br /><br />- Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.<br /><br />- All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.<br /><br />- Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.<br /><br />- Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous.

1706,positive,2021-03-28,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got!

They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).<br /><br />In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.<br /><br />Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.<br /><br />I'm in love.<br /><br />This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.<br /><br />I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.

It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.",1085,edit first review said price little high point noticed local walmart target carry less 9 buy though great coffee coffee dripgrind coffee frenchpress expresso many people love still 5 stars coffee excellent called dark roast tastes like medium mediumdark roast much bitterburnt taste common roasts woody hint citrusy taste little creamy earthy considerable complexity tastes reminds eight clocks bocar blend bocar bold around 23 price eight clocks columbian mostbrewed coffee bold little less complexity woody taste 23 price closely reminds starbucks caffe verona little chocolately taste usually around 8 one sized bag amazon,625

And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.

Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.",993,bars taste quite good although agree reviewers strong coconut taste fine like coconut ordered three times bars fresh time find sticky makes bit messy eaten hiking road trip everyone share polishes quickly personally look ingredients kind bars many fantasies particularly healthy honey sugar fruit nuts concentrated calories healthy fresh fruit vegetables dairy much better job ensuring get vitamins minerals antioxidants need gluten free might help folks doubt eat little pieces bars spaced several hours encourage glycemic spiking compared snickers candy otherwise simply regard tasty snack expected anything,609

As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.<br /><br />""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""<br /><br />""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""<br /><br />""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""<br /><br />""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.<br /><br />I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.",2660,recently watching celtics game friends apartment game grew intense consequently grew parched hey brian said got anything drink yeah replied got lavender soda fridge lavender soda asked skeptical person even get lavender soda sitting table next couch furniture section marshalls bought brian replied walked kitchen interest piqued drinking lavender soda sounded like wonderfully unique experience typically enjoy scent lavender soaps however would soon learn drinking flowerflavored soda would exciting experience hoped would took first sip thought gotten time initial flavor tasted like club soda poured glass contained soap residue previous cleaning interesting thought perhaps flavor subtle first however drinking experience continued came realize would case swallowed soda faced aftertaste rather tasting like soap residue tasted simply like soap like bar soap mouth brought back horrible memories childhood see young boy mother would always threaten wash mouth soap either said bad word said something disrespectful father one always question mothers conviction often found bar soap mouth tremendous lasting psychological effect even twenty years later still taste flavor soap mouth consider saying bad word consequently took first taste lavender soda hit flood emotions felt though said bad word broken rule felt though punished something could recall done vision began become cloudy began lose control small motor functions soon reduced bluthering mess floor bombarded deeplyburied memories vowed never sip soda long shall live lest suffer another episode one described summary soda tastes like lavenderscented soap soda might better suited delicate palate personally prefer,1680

I don't think I've ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though I suppose if you really tried you could do it.  For many years I fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back.  I even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in.

Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)<br /><br />There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.<br /><br />But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling.

I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.

I have no issue with the Stevia.<br /><br />I used to drink a lot of soda, and then a few years back, a lot of diet soda. Since then, I've been able to give up soda altogether. But my Dad who is diabetic, is absolutely obsessed with diet coke. I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.<br /><br />Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.<br /><br />So disappointing. :(",1029,utterly baffled positive reviews product using stevia past year sweeten coffee issue stevia used drink lot soda years back lot diet soda since able give soda altogether dad diabetic absolutely obsessed diet coke trying get lessen diet coke intake 12 day waves research read reviews bought 2 packs cola lemon flavor tried see tasted totally confused tasteless carbonated water taste literally tasted like carbonated water vague hint flavor cannot imagine anyone wanting drink stuff let alone rave get bad batch dad never able transition diet coke stuff stuff truly awful disappointing,583

2881,positive,2021-06-07,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW<br /><br />Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?<br /><br />Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!<br /><br />The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",1786,pasta knorr sauce parma rosa creamy tomato b000i2oopw pardon rave incredible pasta mix totally love sauce love eat pasta usually confined higherfat alfredo sauces cheese sauces acidic tomato sauces irritate acid reflux means spaghetti meatballs frustrating life eh browsing sauce aisle knorr alfredo packets found parma rosa sauce idea vodka sauce reviewers reference whatever good describe would call creamy tomato alfredo even though creamy also light pleasing taste cloying tomato taste exquisite acid content low enough prevent stomach pains taste absolutely wonderful actually talk impulse eating promising parma rosa later good knorr sauces fairly easy make instructions serious say stir constantly though think helps preheat milk adding powdered mix store indefinitely dried packets another reason buy packets besides smaller carbon footprint shipping versus jars oh buying amazon means get half price local market parma rosa also add third pound seasoned browned ground beef easy meatballs portions easily get two full meals one sauce packet sauce stores perfectly fridge coming person generally hates leftovers ana mardoll,1131

Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.

It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).

I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand.<br /><br />This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste.<br /><br />There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes.

Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.

The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.<br /><br />Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.

I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.<br /><br /> When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone buy this product.",1075,first would like say purchased product store seller also problem expiration date coffee picky coffee drinker like kinds prefer stronger brews like flavored coffee well tastes like suppose think anyone wants drink chemical flavored coffee bought product thought going great consumer folgers tried different flavors however first kcup brand bought disappointed coffee definitely flavored taste like caramel sip taste sort chemical taste strong disgusting neither enjoy flavor coffee caramel first time unable finish cup coffee drink entire cup would equivalent torturing would recommend anyone buy product,603

3325,positive,2020-09-25,"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.<br /><br />FYI Nutrition info:<br />Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />Fiber 2g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 2g<br />Sodium 50g<br /><br />BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people.<br />Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!",1867,thought took first bite found amazon managers special slightly less 2box ingredients healthy intriguing 5 seed combination two favorites rosemary garlic since reviews really know expect give try first fresh crunchy sell date 110209 2 months away cute little 15 round crackers really tortilla chips tortilla chip best ever sturdy could scoop anything including thickest guacamole think would break crumble delicious taste got first one nuances every flavor unfortunately diminishes rosemary garlic really discernible still get wonderful corn organic seeds flavor right amount salt way lower 50mg know considered low sodium product many snacks processed foods like jerky lot crackers way salty fyi nutrition info serving size 1oz 16 crackers 28g 4 servingsbox calories 140 total fat 7g saturated fat 1g trans fat cholesterol 0 total carbs 18g fiber 2g sugars 0 protein 2g sodium 50g way gluten free really important lot people crackers box opened intact broken ones mostly bottom bag even though perfect would really good black bean dip guacamole hummus bottom line looking tasty healthy snack crackerchip,1103

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long.

I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality.

3684,positive,2021-05-25,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product.

3757,negative,2021-04-17,"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.

He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal.

The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.<br /><br />I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).<br /><br />Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.

The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.

4016,positive,2021-02-08,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS.

4192,positive,2018-03-22,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.<br /><br />Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).<br /><br />Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.<br /><br />I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.<br /><br />I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.<br /><br />Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.<br /><br />As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.

Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) ""Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food."" Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.<br /><br />update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.<br /><br />5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff.

4227,positive,2020-05-17,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).<br /><br />Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.<br /><br />There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.<br /><br />1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.<br /><br />2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.<br /><br />Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.<br /><br />If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.",2080,10 canister gives 150180 cups coffee nickel cup cannot beat means money premium coffees like starbucks seattles best get 80 cups assuming 4 cup took 4 day 5 days week year would spending 1000 coffee alone money save car payment even starbucks tastes little better really worth coffee taste good premium taste bad either coffee afficionados would let think honestly starbucks via stuff way expensive 1 cup granted instant good really fresh cup freshly ground coffee tastes better coffee coffee freshly ground especially preground coffee bricks cans freeze dried retains freshness longer time kept airsealed get fresh cup almost every time two big downsides 7 ounce containers 1 first time get bottom canister might experience staleness exposure air affects even freezedried coffee one possible solution seal small batches keep away light heat 2 easy add much instant coffee cup takes teaspoon teaspoon half one cup nothing takes little make cup overall nescafe tasters choice offers great balance cost savings taste good fresh brewed perhaps especially get freshly ground coffee make certainly better coffee get say diner restaurant cafes make better 4 cup worth unless occasional indulgence one people always scoffed instant would say least give try,1249

This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process.

4545,negative,2021-05-25,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews.

Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well.

4651,negative,2021-04-08,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this.

4652,negative,2021-07-18,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.

4654,negative,2021-06-15,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success.

4778,negative,2021-04-17,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.",3340,thorougly disgusted betty crocker product glutenfree bisquick shame applaud excellent cake cookie brownie mixes upset coming glutenfree baking mix 1 marketing though equivalent bisquick 2 pricing ridiculously high ingredients regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean andor cottonseed oil leavening dextrose salt ingredients glutenfree bisquick rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gum notice anything missing ingredients glutenfree bisquick yup rightthere shortening oil whole point original bisquicka baking mix already shortening mixed avoids longest messiest step baking things like biscuits people buy baking mixesfor specific convenience betty crocker decided leave shortening oil altogether even though shortening oil always naturally glutenfree cannot pretend safetyforceliacs factor costsavings pure simple breakdown paying 5 pound rice flour 99 cents pound local asian store sugar 288 5 pound bag walmart potato starch also 99 cents pound asian store baking powder 319 pound emergency essentials salt 2 26 ounces mortons xanthan gum 1045 4 ounce amazon yes xanthan gum expensivebut little needed 16ounce box glutenfree bisquick would contain teaspoon xanthan gummaybe 20 cents worth xanthan gum betty crocker charging 5 times would cost make mix home eliminating major convenience factor cost regular baking mix mind making fair profit especially product really equivalent regular bisquick gouging us misleading product make easily less 20 charge since oil glutenfree bisquick easily stir equivalent make 5 pounds time little effort keep several months want real bisquick substitutes betterbatterorg recipe site cupforcup substitute bisquick shortening nonfat dry milk powder buttermilk powder even vances dairyfree powder makes 10 cups time stores well glutenfree flouryou glutenfree flour replacement want like rice flour potato starch local asian store mixed appropriate amount xanthan gum 12 teaspoon every two cups find recipe google search betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix boo betty crocker,2125

4859,negative,2021-07-15,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.

The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products.

Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.<br /><br />Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.<br />NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",1803,little lesson truffles truffles graded extra larger second highest truffle quality best used conclusion cooking process release aroma perfume chefs suggest slice shave thinly pastas risottos omelets whole entire truffles marked brushed means cleaned soil dirt preserved brine truffle juice discarded flavor sauced broths ready preserved truffles nice budgetfriendly way add visual truffle appeal dishes however looking add pungent aroma taste truffles dish chefs recommend explore fresh truffle selections jarred canned truffles sold vendors mere shadows fresh truffle selves deliver aroma flavor fresh truffles great truffle oil oil add flavor preserved truffles truffle look preserved truffles used garnish dish conjunction truffle butter oil times fresh truffles season budget allow real thing note preserved truffles jar almost flavor odor looking true flavor fresh truffle please go seek fresh truffle pages online purchase fresh truffle looking add truffle look dish product better buy real truffle oil experiment example jr mushrooms specialties amazon good startabout 10 dollars low commitment line superior bottle extra virgin olive oil evoo,1150

5110,negative,2021-01-21,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.

Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale, without any fruity characteristic of peaberries, and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.

The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

5220,negative,2019-12-12,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br

5297,negative,2018-01-16,"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.

I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?

In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky.
